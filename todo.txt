[] Update rand dependency in root bin. Currently using lower version because of secp256k1 crate interoperability
[] Make sure all crypto is well implemented and in as few dependencies as possible
[] Find a way to get rid of ring (the lib) or to go full ring
[] Make sure the right unicode NFKD is being used for generating seeds from bip39. Pretty sure the current implementation fails for things that actually change under NFKD.
[] Make a PeerConnection valid only for a given network (it doesn't make sense to send messages of different networks in the same connection - the port is different)
  [] Inside a PeerConnection from a network, close connection if we receive messages from another network
